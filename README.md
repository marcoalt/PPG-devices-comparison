# PPG devices comparison
Comparison of PPG sensors (HRV4Training camera-based algorithms, Mio alpha, Schosche Rhythm+ and Kyto HRM-2931) with respect to a chest strap (Polar H7). 

All data are available in the /data folder and were collected using the sensors mentioned above and the HRV Logger app for iOS. Reference data from Polar H7 and HRV4Training data were collected using a custom app that can capture simultaneously both and is not commercially available.

More info on the setup and analysis can be found on the HRV4Training Blog at this link: http://www.hrv4training.com/blog/comparison-of-different-devices-using-photoplethysmography-ppg-to-extract-rr-intervals-can-we-use-them-for-hrv-analysis
